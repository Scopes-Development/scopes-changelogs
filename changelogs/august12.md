## Introducing: **PROFILES**!
### About profiles
- Gain achievements from using commands
- Add your friends using our friends system
- See how many commands you've used on Scopes
And much more!

#### How do I start?
Simple! Use `s.prof` and the bot will automatically create an account for you. The username will be random, but to change it, you will have to use `s.profile-edit username [new username]`.

Use `s.help` and go to page 13 to see the full commands list of profiles.
